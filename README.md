Improving E-Banking Security Using Biometrics: Face Recognition
Digitalization of banking sector is a curse for the masses who still can’t use internet, let alone managing e-mail accounts. 
These people now have to maintain their bank accounts online and carryout transactions. 

The number of ways these people can be exploited is infinite.
There can never be a perfect solution to stay secure in the matter of E-Banking, however 
through this project we are attempting to achieve security for E-Banking and our project may
provide a solid reliable solution.
Our project is titled as ‘Improving E-Banking Security using Biometrics ’.

As we know every person has his own unique biometric characteristics. Based on this attribute we are designing
a method for security in E-Banking which is secure in every way than the current, traditional
security majors taken for security in E-Banking sector.

TO understand and get familier with the project, you need to understsand first of all frontend part. 
every banking website contains signup and login system. We also covered that same functionality. Once a user completes the login
process. Now, a real project comes into the picture. Here user has to pass one authentication system i.e face recognition.
We have created one face recognition model which uses Principle Component Analysis(PCA) for face detection.
TO achive high accuracy first of all model gets trained using raw data of images(faces).
Once it is trained it matches captured user image 
to the image which is stored in database already in .bmp format.

Hope you understood the project and Thank you !!!
